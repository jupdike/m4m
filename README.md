# M4M: Mathematics for Minecrafters

This is a simple vibe-coded quiz to help kids learn some arithmetic using familiar crafting recipes.

This project is not associated with Mojang, Microsoft, or Minecraft.

To run the app simply use Python to make a simple local server:

> python -m http.server 8000

or whatever port you want, then load the localhost:8000 server in your browser. To deploy to a static web host, simply SFTP the files to a folder and the app should function with no backend, just client-side browser smarts.

Try it in your browser now, at [m4m.updike.org](https://m4m.updike.org/).
